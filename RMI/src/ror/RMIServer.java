package ror;
/* This does not offer the code of the whole communication module 
   (CM) for RMI: but it gives some hints about how you can make 
   it. I call it simply "yourRMI". 

   For example, it  shows how you can get the host name etc.,
   (well you can hardwire it if you like, I should say),
   or how you can make a class out of classname as a string.

   This just shows one design option. Other options are
   possible. We assume there is a unique skeleton for each
   remote object class (not object) which is called by CM 
   by static methods for unmarshalling etc. We can do without
   it, in which case CM does marshalling/unmarhshalling.
   Which is simpler, I cannot say, since both have their
   own simpleness and complexity.
